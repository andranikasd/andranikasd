Welcome to my portfolio repository! I'm Andranik Grigoryan – a seasoned DevOps expert passionate about automating, optimizing, and securing cloud infrastructures. This repository highlights the tools I use and the projects that exemplify my work in building scalable, reliable systems.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

I work with a diverse set of industry-leading tools to create cutting-edge solutions:

- **Kubernetes** 🐳 – Container orchestration for scalable applications.
- **Terraform** 🌍 – Infrastructure as Code to build, change, and version infrastructure safely.
- **Ansible** 🤖 – Automation for configuration management and application deployment.
- **AWS** ☁️ – Cloud computing platform with robust infrastructure services.
- **Azure** ☁️ – Enterprise-level cloud services and integrations.
- **Prometheus/Grafana** 📊 – Monitoring, alerting, and data visualization.
- **Helm** 📦 – Package manager for Kubernetes to streamline deployments.
- **GitLab CI/CD** 🔄 – Automating build, test, and deployment pipelines.
- **HashiCorp Vault & Keycloak** 🔐 – Security and identity management for zero-trust environments.
- **Cilium** 🛡️ – Secure pod-to-pod and node-to-node communications in Kubernetes.

## 📁 Projects

Here are some highlights of my projects where I leverage these tools to deliver robust and innovative solutions:

- **Automated Orchestration System**  
  A cutting-edge solution deploying Kubernetes clusters in edge locations. Built with Ansible for seamless deployments, this project features:
  - Automated orchestration of bare-metal nodes.
  - A zero-trust security architecture using HashiCorp Vault, Keycloak, and Cilium.
  - Production-grade monitoring and observability with Prometheus and Grafana.
  - A fully configured development platform on a bare-metal Kubernetes cluster.

- **Resilient Storage & Deployment**  
  Designed and implemented reliable file storage systems using Longhorn and Minio, combined with CNCF database operator systems. This project also includes:
  - Custom Ansible playbooks for high-availability Kubernetes deployments.
  - Air-gap deployment strategies featuring a self-hosted GitLab and ArgoCD pipeline.

- **Integrated Security & SSO Solutions**  
  Developed and integrated a Keycloak Helm chart to automate the deployment of users, realms, and configurations for streamlined Single Sign-On (SSO) across multiple services.
